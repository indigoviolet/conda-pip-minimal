* TODO
- [X] name: should not be the prefix; since it breaks mamba env update --file
- [X] pipdeptree: uses the wrong python when it is running from pipx
- [X] Sort dependencies to put Python, pip on top, sort others alphabetically
- [X] -included pypi packages should show in pypi, even if they are conda package's dependency
- export in pip install format (==) ; mamba install format (so that we can do --freeze-installed)
