* TODO
- [X] name: should not be the prefix; since it breaks mamba env update --file
- [X] pipdeptree: uses the wrong python when it is running from pipx
- [X] Sort dependencies to put Python, pip on top, sort others alphabetically
- [X] -included pypi packages should show in pypi, even if they are conda package's dependency
- [X] Handle bug in heuristic name selection for prefix conda environments
- export in pip install format (==) ; mamba install format (so that we can do --freeze-installed)
- [ ] Handle git+https urls etc: https://github.com/conda/conda/blob/main/tests/conda_env/support/advanced-pip/environment.yml
- [ ] Handle conda being function not an executable (accept path to "conda_exe"?)
